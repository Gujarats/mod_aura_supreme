# Aura Supreme Mod

An active ability and perk modification for **Battle Brothers**, built using the Modding Standards & Utilities (MSU) framework and Modern Hooks. 

This mod introduces a terrifying, high-tier ability that allows an elite character to completely shatter the morale of surrounding enemies, forcing them into an immediate rout once per battle.

## 🚀 Features

* **Custom Active Skill ("Aura Supreme"):** Forces all enemies within a specified tile radius to instantly fail their morale checks and transition into the **Fleeing** state.
* **Dynamic Menu Configuration (MSU):** No script editing required. Adjust balance variables directly from the in-game Mod Settings menu.
* **Perk Tree Integration:** Fully integrated into the character perk tree grid as a pickable talent.

## ⚙️ Dynamic Configurations (In-Game Settings)

Through the **Mod Settings** menu, you can dynamically configure the following parameters on the fly:

1. **Perk Level Requirement:** Adjust which level row (Tier 1 to 10) the perk appears on (Default: Row 7).
2. **Once Per Battle Restriction:** Toggle whether the ability can only be cast a single time per combat encounter, or used continuously (Default: Enabled).
3. **Aura Effect Radius:** Dynamically scale the area of effect from 1 to 3 tiles out from the caster (Default: 3 Tiles).

## 📁 Repository & Folder Structure

The project code maintains a strict separation of concerns, separating early game engine initialization from runtime combat logic loops:
